# OnionDomainExtractor

## Description
**OnionDomainExtractor** is a Python script designed to automate the search for and extraction of `.onion` domains from the dark web using the [OnionSearch](https://github.com/megadose/OnionSearch) tool, published by [megadose](https://github.com/megadose). This project enhances the capabilities of the [**OnionScanner**](https://github.com/N4rr34n6/OnionScanner) project by streamlining the collection and classification of onion domain information, making it a valuable tool for researchers, cybersecurity experts, and privacy advocates.

## Unique Features
- **Concurrent Processing**: Efficiently searches multiple keywords simultaneously, drastically reducing search time.
- **Automated Classification**: Continuously checks and classifies domains based on HTML content, enabling a thorough exploration of relevant sites.
- **Comprehensive Output**: Generates detailed lists of found domains, categorizing them based on relevance to specified keywords.

## How It Works
The script starts the Tor service to access the .onion network. It reads keywords from a specified text file and employs `OnionSearch` to find matching domains. After extraction, it uses `curl` to fetch the HTML content of these domains and searches for keyword matches. This loop continues, ensuring that new domains are regularly classified based on their content.

## Use Cases
- **Cybersecurity Research**: Analyze hidden services and gather intelligence on potential threats.
- **Privacy Studies**: Investigate the dark web's impact on personal privacy and anonymity.
- **Market Research**: Explore niche markets that exist within the dark web.

## Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```plaintext
python3
tor
onionsearch
torsocks
```

You can install the required Python libraries using pip. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

```plaintext
concurrent.futures
```

## Installation
1. Install Tor:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install tor
   ```
2. Install OnionSearch:
   ```bash
   pip3 install onionsearch
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/N4rr34n6/OnionDomainExtractor.git
   cd OnionDomainExtractor
   ```
## Usage
1. Prepare the `Keywords.txt` file with relevant keywords.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 onion_domain_extractor.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to initiate the search with `OnionSearch`.

## Example Output
The output files generated by the script include:
- **onion_domains_list.txt**: A list of extracted .onion domains.
- **domains_to_scan.txt**: Domains classified as matching specified keywords.
- **domains_no_match.txt**: Domains that do not match the keywords.
